# 3D_Weld_Seam_Detection_and_Tracking_using_PCL_ROS_ANN
In this project we have developed an algorithm to autonomously detect 3D weld seams on workpiece of any geometrical shape using Point Cloud Library. Further we have used Neural Networks to trace the detected weld seam using a 5 DOF Robotic Manipulator. Other projects like autonomous_grasping using feature matching are also included.
